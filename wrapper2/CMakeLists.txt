# The way the PYTHON_MODULE_PATH might seem a bit strange. There are two main reasons
# why it is done this way:

# 1) We go the detour via PYTHON_EXECUTABLE instead of accessing PYTHON_LIBRARIES
#    directly as this can lead to problems when the found python interpreter was
#    installed with Homebrew. Going the detour ensures that the found interpreter
#    and libraries belong to the same python installation

# 2) There is a function "FindPython" in CMake 3.12 (most recent version of CMake in Aug 2018).
#    that has a return value "Python_SITELIB" which is basically just what we need.
#    But we decided not to rely on it as because it is so recent.

#    You have two options to build EuclidEmulator on a machine without root access:                   #

#    Option A:  Build EuclidEmulator within a virtual environment.                                    #
